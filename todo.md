# Keyboard-Style Interactive Portfolio Generator - TODO

## Project Setup & Architecture

- [x] Set up React project with Vite and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Install required dependencies (React Router, additional animation libraries if needed)
- [x] Create project folder structure (components/, data/, styles/, utils/)
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme colors and animations

## JSON Data Structures

- [x] Design and create about.json with personal information structure
- [x] Design and create projects.json with project portfolio data
- [x] Design and create skills.json with technical skills and proficiency levels
- [x] Design and create contact.json with contact information and social links

## Core UI Components

- [x] Build KeyButton component with keyboard key styling and interactions
- [x] Create AnimatedBackground component with floating keyboard elements
- [x] Develop JsonSectionLoader component for dynamic data fetching and rendering
- [x] Build modal/popup components for content display

## Styling & Themes

- [x] Implement keyboard-inspired design system (keycaps, shadows, glassmorphism)
- [x] Create color palette system (blue, purple, teal, cyber themes)
- [x] Develop theme switching functionality (light, dark, RGB modes)
- [x] Add RGB glow and neon effects for keycaps

## Animations & Interactions

- [x] Implement hover effects (lift up, glow) for KeyButton
- [x] Add press-click animations (press-down, pop-in effects)
- [x] Create floating background animations (parallax, fade, slow movement)
- [x] Add smooth transitions between sections and modals

## Data Fetching & Integration

- [x] Implement modular JSON fetching system
- [x] Connect JsonSectionLoader to all data files
- [x] Add error handling for data loading
- [x] Implement loading states and fallbacks

## Responsive Design & UX

- [ ] Ensure mobile-responsive keyboard layout
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions for mobile devices
- [ ] Test and refine user experience across devices
- [ ] Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

## Performance & Optimization

- [ ] Optimize component rendering and re-renders
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] Minify and optimize assets
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Testing & Deployment

- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Test data fetching and error scenarios
- [ ] Set up deployment configuration
- [ ] Create build and deployment scripts

## Final Polish

- [ ] Add final visual touches and refinements
- [ ] Conduct cross-browser testing
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate on design
- [ ] Prepare documentation for maintenance
